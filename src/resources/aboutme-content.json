    "My name is Ryan Nelson. I am a rising fourth year university student at University of California, Santa Cruz. I am studying computer science, a subject that I am passionate about. I have high standards for myself, my work, and anything I do, including how I interact with people in my life.",
    "I have enjoyed learning about computer science since I was a child. Early in my life, I was introduced to technology. I loved working on interesting softwares dealing with animation, game development, art, and other topics. I started to learn how to code when I wanted more creative freedom that simple beginner game engines couldn't give me. I used online resources and followed a YouTube tutorial series to learn Java. Since then, I have spent much of my time learning about different softwares, coding languages, libraries, and other resources that I find interesting.",
    "Beyond being a software engineer, I enjoy a wide variety of general hobbies. I like to play sports as well as spend quality time with friends. I play Ultimate Frisbee as a player on the UCSC B Team. I have enjoyed learning the sport, building positive relationships with my teammates, and competing hard. I also enjoy surfing, rock climbing, long-distance running, basketball, volleyball, snowboarding, and plenty of other activities.",
    "I am always looking forward to opportunities of any kind, including meeting new people, joining a team, and working on a fun project. Please feel free to get in touch if you believe you have an opportunity worth sharing. Thank you."
